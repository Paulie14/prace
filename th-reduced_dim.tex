The goal of this chapter is to introduce several concepts of combining models of different spatial dimension and 
to put this work into the context of the so called \emph{reduced dimensional models}.
At the end we define a~well aquifer model, combining 1d-2d and 1d-3d dimensions, which is to be solved in this work.
Also the relationship to the long-term research at the Technical University in Liberec is described.%\\

The realistic models of underground processes, namely the groundwater flow and transport, geomechanics and thermal processes, have to deal with 
a complex of geological formations containing various small scale features such as fractures and wells. Although the scale of these features
can differ from the size of the computational domain by several orders, they influence significantly the global behavior of the system.
In the past years, two different approaches for incorporating these features into numerical models have been developed.

% Equivalent continuum
% - simple, computationaly cheaper
% - lack of detailed data (underground hydrogeological properties, neglect microscopic effects), allows the user to simplify the model
% - smooths out the discontinuities; instead of modelling 3d domain with fractures, a~3d domain with equivalent properties (in the means of global behaviour) is applied

The equivalent continuum concept includes the fractures and wells in the model by changing the global properties of the modeled volume
(increased/decreased hydraulic conductivity, porosity, diffusivity or other rock properties).
This approach smears the local effects of the disruptions but the model can still provide a~valid approximation for an initial global view of the system.
For example, instead of having a~bulk rock with a~complex network of conductive fractures, we use an equivalent continuum with increased conductivity,
and the domain can be simply discretized without taking the fractures into account any further.
The concept is also suitable due to the lack of detailed data which people suffer from in most applications.
%TODO FVM, FDM, FEM abbreviations
The microscopic effects are neglected by applying the representative elementary volume (homogenization per elements of mesh in FVM, FDM or FEM),
the macroscopic effects (larger fractures) can be modeled by equivalent continuum.
Since the underlying computational mesh does not need to represent the small scale objects, the equivalent continuum models can be computationally cheap,
but they cannot capture the local effects accurately.

\label{fig:multi-dim}
\end{figure}

% Discrete approach (reduced dimensions)
% - more computationaly costly - representation of discrete fractures
% - enables to neglect the 3d or 2d dimensions of fracture or channel, respectively, on the meshing level.
% - the equivalent continuum concept is still applied on the lower level of details (inside fractures/channels, in 3d bulk between fractures)
% - leads to reduced dimensional models (fracture in 3d is a~plane -- averaging in the thickness axis, channel is a~line -- averaging in circular cross-section )
% 
% - discrete fracture network (DFN) - only fracture network vs coupling with 3d

The other approach considers the disruptions in a~discrete sense, keeping its sizes and properties explicitly in the model.
This brings more demanding work on the geometric level, where the disruptions have to be represented so that a~suitable computational mesh can be built.
A significant simplification in this concept is to reduce the dimension of the local phenomena, if possible,
and to represent these as lower dimensional objects. This means on the geometrical level to neglect the thickness of a~thin fracture and consider a~plane, or
neglect the cross-section of a~narrow channel and consider a~line instead. The quantities are then averaged over the complementary dimensions.
This approach is referred as \emph{reducing dimensions} or \emph{reduced dimensional model}.

Within the scope of geology or hydrogeology, the reduced dimension concept is used in the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models.
There is a~world-wide community around the DFN problematic, see e.g. \cite{jing_fundamentals_dfn_2007, lei_use_dfn_2017} for an overview.
The people are dealing with a~wide range of topics on DFN,
from the definition and measurement of the geological parameters, stochastic generation of DFN and its discretization for FVM/FEM methods,
to solving multi-physic problems on such geometries. We may differentiate between two types of fracture network models. One is strictly considering only
the fracture network itself, without considering the bulk domain between fractures. Such model can predict for example the so called \emph{preferential paths}
in concentration transport problems, assuming the transport through the bulk domain is negligible. The other model takes the processes running in the bulk domain
into account, so it needs to solve the communication between the fracture and bulk domains in addition, which puts an extra effort on discretization,
coupling conditions and solution of the underlying linear system.
Some upscaling techniques regarding DFN are also being developed, where the idea is to have a very complex DFN on the most refined level and only the most influential
parts of the DFN (or none) on the coarsest level.

Having the geometry of a~reduced dimensional model prepared, the space discretization then follows,
leading to the meshes of combined dimensions, i.e. composed of elements of different dimension.
This approach, called mixed-dimensional analysis in the mechanics \cite{bournival_mesh-geometry_2008},
is also studied in the groundwater context, see e.g.
\cite{martin_modeling_2005, fumagalli_numerical_2011, dangelo_mixed_2012, pichot_generalized_2012, brezina_analysis_2015}
and already adopted by some groundwater simulation software, e.g FeFlow \cite{trefry_feflow_2007} and Flow123d \cite{flow123d}.

The works mentioned before deal with modeling fractures, however they are not concerned neither about 1d-3d coupling
nor point intersections in non-planar 1d-2d coupling. These topics are also studied extensively by different groups, see
especially \cite{dangelo_coupling_2008, cattaneo_numerical_2015} and \cite{koppl_tum_2015, koppl_vidotto_2018}.
Their applications are mainly addressed to the medical problematic and they analyze the transport of medicaments through
the vascular system and to the surrounding tissue. The veins can be viewed as 1d channels and the tissue is modeled as a~porous media,
and thus the flow is governed by the same type of equations as in the groundwater simulations.

In this work we build and expanse a reduced dimensional model on top of the existing one being developed at TUL.
It combines both the equivalent continuum and the DFN approach including the communication fractures with surrounding bulk domains.
Since the numerical solution is based on FEM, we are interested in how the fractures and bulk are geometrically discretized.
Therefore we describe the meshes of combined dimensions below.

% - introduce concept of meshes of combined dimensions
% - come to reduce dimensional models
% - explain problematics of geometry discretisation for FEM (in general)

% - who uses these models:

% The discretization then leads to the meshes of mixed dimensions, i.e. composed of elements of different dimension. This approach 
% called mixed-dimensional analysis in the mechanics \cite{bournival_mesh-geometry_2008} is also studied in the groundwater context, see e.g.

\section{Mesh of Combined Dimensions} \label{sec:mesh_combined}
The motivation to model the small scale disruptions in the bulk domain as lower dimensional objects has been
stated in the introduction of the chapter. Now we fix the idea of a~mesh of combined dimensions and we give
a~more precise description.

An open set $\Omega_{3} \subset \Real^3$ represents a~continuous approximation of a~porous medium, i.e. the bulk domain.
In the same manner, a~set of 2d manifolds $\Omega_2 \subset \Real^3$ is considered, representing the 2d fractures
and a~set of 1d manifolds $\Omega_1 \subset \Real^3$ representing the 1d channels in an arbitrary 3d space.
See the Figure \ref{fig:multi-dim}.


The domains $\Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1$ are polytopic (i.e. polygonal and piecewise linear, respectively).
Following the documentation of Flow123d \cite{flow123d_doc_2018} and its notation,
for every dimension $d=1,2,3$, a~triangulation $\mathcal{T}_{d}$ of the open set $\Omega_d$
is introduced that consists of
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \textrm{elements } & T_{d}^{i}, & \quad i \in\mathcal{I}_{d,E} = \{1,\dots,N_{d,E} \}, \\
    \textrm{faces }    & F_{d}^{i}, & \quad i \in\mathcal{I}_{d,F} = \{1,\dots,N_{d,F} \}, \\
    \textrm{nodes }    & \vc x_{i}, & \quad i \in\mathcal{I}_{d,N} = \{1,\dots,N_{d,N} \}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

% Simplicial meshes are used, so the elements are lines, triangles and tetrahedra.
If not specified, the simplicial meshes are used, so the elements are lines, triangles and tetrahedra.
By faces $F^i_d$ we understand $(d-1)$-dimensional boundary objects of elements $T_d^i$,
i.e. end points $F^i_1$ of $T^i_1$, triangle sides $F^i_2$ of $T^i_2$, tetrahedron faces $F^i_3$ of $T^i_3$.
We note that in Chapter \ref{chap:xfem_pressure}, the quadrilateral elements are considered in contrast to the rest of the work
due to the use of a~specific FEM library code.

% $\Omega_2\subset\overline\Omega_3$
% $\Omega_1\subset \overline\Omega_2$

The elements in \emph{a compatible mesh} must satisfy the following compatibility conditions
\begin{equation}
        T_{d-1}^i \cap \mathcal{T}_d \subset \mathcal{F}_d,  \qquad \text{where } \mathcal{F}_d = \bigcup_{k\in\mathcal{I}_{d,E}} \partial T_{d}^{k}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
        T_{d-1}^i \cap \mathcal{F}_d = 
        \begin{cases}
            T_{d-1}^i, \\
            \emptyset,
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
for every $\,i\in\mathcal{I}_{d-1,E}$, and $d=2,3$. 
That is, the $(d-1)$-dimensional elements are either between $d$-dimensional elements and
match their faces or they poke out of $\Omega_d$. 
Under these conditions, a compatible 1d line in 3d space is formed only as an intersection of 
two 2d planes.
Direct compatibility in case of co-dimension 2, i.e. for 1d and 3d coupling, is not considered.


A creation of a~compatible mesh can be challenging on the algorithms, due to the compatibility conditions.
The requirements on the element quality can be also limiting, since the intersection of domains can be very arbitrary.
Therefore we look for models not requiring the compatible meshes.

\emph{An incompatible mesh}, also referred as non-conforming or non-matching, does not have to satisfy the compatibility equations above.
The creation of the mesh is much simpler when it can be done independently per domain.
On the other hand, there are three main challenges on the next levels of the model solution.
First, the intersections of the mesh elements must be computed efficiently and the intersection data
must be represented in such a way that it can be used simply and cheaply in the FEM code.
Second, an efficient numerical integration must be available on the intersecting polygons.
Third, stable coupling conditions between dimensions must be provided.
Part of this work, Chapter \ref{chap:intersections}, is dedicated to a~development of algorithms
for computation of intersections of incompatible meshes.


% From the general point of view the problem can be seen as a~strongly coupled model where the coupling is not
% among physical fields but among domains of different dimensions. The coupling is then performed via boundary
% conditions and source terms of the fields equations. The term strongly coupled is used because the coupling 
% is apparently bidirectional, the system can hardly be decoupled (meaning solving the PDEs separately). 





\newpage
\section{Well-Aquifer Model}
A~well-aquifer model that we solve in our work is defined in this section.
We follow the reduced dimension concept and introduce a simplified underground water flow model.

We consider wells (or boreholes, channels) to be straight narrow tubes (cylinders) $\Omega^w_C$ of radius $\rho_w$;
we use the index $w\in\mathcal{W}=\{1\ldots W\}$ when referring to a~particular well.
Using the reduced dimensional concept, the wells are modeled as lower dimensional objects,
i.e. 1d manifolds $\Omega^w_1$ which represent the central lines of cylinders $\Omega^w_C$.
The 1d manifold $\Omega^w_1$ can be parameterized using a~mapping $\nu_w: [0,1] \rightarrow \Omega^w_1$:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:1d_parametrization}
    \Omega^w_1 = \{\vc x\in\R^3: \vc x = \nu_w(t),\; t\in[0,1] \}. %\quad \nu_w: [0,1] \rightarrow \Omega^w_1
\end{equation}
Later in the text we suppose that functions in $\Omega^w_1$ depend on the relevant parameter $t$.
We define a~lateral surface of a~cylinder $\Omega^w_C$
\begin{equation}
    \prtl\Omega^w_C = \{\vc x\in\R^3: \vc x = \nu_w(t) + \vc r,\; \vc r=\rho_w\vc n_{\Omega^w_1}(t),\; t\in[0,1] \},
\end{equation}
% \[
%     \prtl\Omega^w_C = \{\vc x\in\R^3: \vc x = \vc y + \vc r,\; \vc y\in\Omega^w_1,\; \vc r=\rho_w\vc n_{\Omega^w_1} \},
% \]
where $\vc n_{\Omega^w_1}(t)$ is the unit normal vector to the line $\Omega^w_1$ at point $t$.
% We further denote $\vc t_w$ a direction vector of $\Omega^w_1$ and define the parametrization of the reduced domain
% \[
%     \Omega^w_1 = \{\vc x\in\R^3: \vc x = t \vc t_w,\; t\in[0,1]\}.
% \]

The domain of a~well $\Omega^w_1$ has a~boundary (obviously consisting of two end points)
$\Gamma_1 = \Gamma_{1D} \cup \Gamma_{1N}$, where pressure (Dirichlet boundary condition)
or flux (Neumann boundary condition) is prescribed.
If possible, and apparent from context, we denote the domains of all wells by
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_1 = \bigcup_{w\in\mathcal{W}} \Omega^w_1, \quad \Omega_C = \bigcup_{w\in\mathcal{W}} \Omega^w_C.
\end{equation}

A~steady groundwater flow governed by Darcy's law is considered in aquifers.
The same is considered also in wells for simplicity:
we can imagine the wells filled with different porous material, or in some tests we fix pressure in wells to a~constant value.
Without any coupling terms, we would write for every dimension $d$
\begin{eqnarray}
     \frac{1}{\delta_d} \vc K_d^{-1} \vc u_d + \grad p_d =& 0  &\qquad \textrm{ in }\Omega_d\\
      \div\,\vc u_d  =& \delta_d f_d  &\qquad \textrm{ in }\Omega_d
\end{eqnarray}
where $\delta_d\vc u_d\; [ms^{-1}]$ is the unknown Darcian velocity, $p_d \; [m]$ is the unknown pressure.
Parameter $\delta_d$ is the complement measure of the domain: thickness $[m]$ in 2d,
cross-section $[m^2]$ in 1d and $\delta_3=1\; [-]$ for consistency. Since the wells are considered as cylinders,
the cross-section $\delta_1$ is constant per well: $\delta_1(\vc x)=\delta^w_1=\pi\rho^2_w$ for all $\vc x\in \Omega^w_1$.
The quantity $\vc u_d\; [m^{d-4}s^{-1}]$ itself can be seen as flux density, i.e. flux through $\Omega_d$
with complementary dimension $\delta_d=1$.
The conductivity tensor $\vc K_d\; [ms^{-1}]$ is generally $3\times 3$ matrix,
symmetric and positive definite, possibly representing the anisotropy of the media.
In the source term, $f_d\;[s^{-1}]$ denotes the water source density.

We note that we use the same operators $\div$ and $\grad$ in all dimensions $d=1,2,3$ for the sake of notation simplicity,
although in 1d we understand these as follows
\begin{eqnarray}
\div\,\vc u_1 = \div_t\,\vc u_1 = \frac{\prtl}{\prtl t} \vc u_1(t), \\
\grad p_1 = \grad_t p_1 = \frac{\prtl}{\prtl t} p_1(t),
\end{eqnarray}
with $t$ being the 1d parameter in \eqref{eqn:1d_parametrization}.

Two models are presented below, the first one supposes further simplifications and includes 1d-2d coupling between dimensions,
the other one couples 1d and 3d domains together.


\subsection{1d-2d Model}
We consider a~system of aquifers separated by aquitards
(based on Gracie and Craig \cite{gracie_modelling_2010,craig_using_2011}).
The aquifers are underground horizontal layers of permeable rock containing water in its pores.
These layers often have negligible flow in the vertical direction so they can be modeled
as 2d planes by means of the reduced dimensional modeling.
There can be several aquifers on top of each other, separated by layers of very low permeability
which are called aquitards.
In contrast to Gracie and Craig, we suppose the aquitards to be impermeable, 
so the aquifers can communicate between each other only through the wells.
See the scheme of well-aquifer model in \fig{fig:well_flows}.
On the other hand, we add an artificial volume source term on aquifers.
This allows us to better study the impact of the prescribed source on the solution
which is better suited to the numerical experiments we are going to present. 

The model is defined as a~complex multi-aquifer system to follow our implementation and to see the differences
we made in comparison to Gracie and Craig. However, before solving the complex model,
we constrain ourselves to a~single aquifer in a~major part of the work.

  \label{fig:well_flows}
\end{figure}

Let $\Omega^m_2$ be the domain of an aquifer with index $m\in\mathcal{M}=\{1\ldots M\}$.
We denote the aquifers' boundary $\prtl\Omega^m_2 = \Gamma^m_{ext} \cup \Gamma^m_{int}$,
where we call $\Gamma^m_{ext} = \Gamma^m_{2D} \cup \Gamma^m_{2N}$ the exterior boundary, consisting of two parts where we prescribe
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition, respectively.
The interior boundary $\Gamma^m_{int}$ is created by an union of all the cross-sections of the aquifer domain $\Omega^m_2$
and wells lateral surfaces
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma^m_{int} = \bigcup_{\substack{w\in\mathcal{W}}} \Gamma^m_w, \quad \Gamma^m_w = \Omega^m_2 \cap \prtl\Omega^w_C.
\end{equation}
Where possible, we again use the simplified notation
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_2 = \bigcup_{m\in\mathcal{M}} \Omega^w_2, \quad \Gamma_{\#} = \bigcup_{m\in\mathcal{M}} \Gamma^m_{\#}
\end{equation}
with $\#$ being $ext,\; int,\; 2D$ or $2N$.

On $\Gamma^m_w$, we define the following decomposition of an arbitrary function $q\in C(\overbar\Omega^m_2)$ on average and fluctuation parts, 
in the same manner as it can be found in \cite{koppl_vidotto_2018},
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:average_decomposition}
    q = \avg{q}^m_w + \fluct{q}^m_w \quad \textrm{on } \Gamma^m_w,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:average_definition}
    \avg{q}^m_w = \frac{1}{{\abs{\Gamma^m_w}}} \int_{\Gamma^m_w} q \dd s.
\end{equation}
It holds for the fluctuation term from the definition \eqref{eqn:average_definition}
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Gamma^m_w} \fluct{q}^m_w \dd s = \int_{\Gamma^m_w} q - \avg{q}^m_w \dd s = 0.
\end{equation}
% \notePE{Why do we use the averaging: - without it, the models on communicating dimension would be to tight, bad for numerical solution,
% arising from hte models with Dirac delta sources}
The average term is linear, since it holds 
\begin{equation}
    \avg{q_1+q_2}^m_w = \avg{q_1}^m_w + \avg{q_2}^m_w.
\end{equation}

The point where the reduced domain $\Omega^w_1$ intersects with aquifer $\Omega^m_2$ is denoted $\vc x^m_w=\nu_w(t^m)$.
In order to prescribe a~communication term in $\Omega^w_1$, we use a~Dirac measure at the point $t^m$
\begin{equation}
    \delta_t(t - t^m) = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & t = t^m \\
        0 & t \neq t^m
    \end{cases}, 
    \quad \int_0^1 q(t) \delta_t(t - t^m) \dd t = q(t^m), \quad q\in C(\overbar\Omega^w_1).
\end{equation}

Then we can write the entire problem:
\thmproblem{ \label{thm:problem_2d}

%   \end{alignat}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\[ 
{\color{blue}
    \Sigma^m_w = \delta_2(\vc x^m_w)\sigma^m_w\big(\avg{p_2}^m_w-p_1(\vc x^m_w)\big).
} 
\label{eqn:1d_2d_sigma_source}
\]
}

One can see the dimensional coupling terms highlighted in the blue color.
The term $\Sigma^m_w$ is a~constant representing the flux density from the aquifer $\Omega^m_2$ to the well $\Omega^w_1$
through their intersection $\Gamma^m_w$. 
The flux is proportional to the pressure difference with the permeability coefficient $\sigma^m_w>0\;[s^{-1}]$ between $\Omega^m_2$ and $\Omega^w_1$.
If the pressure difference is negative, the flux is in opposite direction.
We can then read: the average outward flux from the aquifer
over $\Gamma^m_w$ in \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_flux_avg} acts as a~positive source term in the well in \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_1d_source}.

The equation \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_press_fluct} prescribes the fluctuation of pressure on $\Gamma^m_w$,
which is not defined by the coupling terms. In reality, wells are very narrow in comparison to the scale of aquifers
and so the changes in pressure on $\Gamma^m_w$ are very small. Thus we consider $g^m_w \approx \rho_w$ and
we neglect the effects of $g^m_w$ as shown later.

% Eventually, it is worth noticing that the flux between dimensions is approximated by a~single value,
% although the flux over $\Gamma^m_w$ can change arbitrarily.

% In \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_1d_source} we used the Dirac measure at the point $\vc x^m_w$
% \[
%     \delta(\vc x - \vc x^m_w) = 
%     \begin{cases}
%         1 & \vc x = \vc x^m_w, \\
%         0 & \vc x \neq \vc x^m_w,
%     \end{cases}, 
%     \qquad \int_{\Omega^w_1}q(\vc x) \delta(\vc x - \vc x^m_w) \dd\bx = q(\vc x^m_w).
% \]
% to express the concentration of $\Sigma^m_w$ at point.
The last two equations are the boundary conditions, the first one \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_dirichlet} prescribes the boundary pressure $g_{dD}$, 
the later one \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_neumann} sets the inward flux $g_{dN}$. The sign of the flux in \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_neumann}
is chosen such that it is consistent with the software Flow123d.

The problematic place of a reduced dimensional model, if done in the simplest way, would be that after the reduction of wells,
the 1d-2d intersections are degenerated to points. Then the term in the flux coupling condition \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_flux_avg} would rather
appear as a~point source on the right hand side of \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_2d_source} creating strong singularities in the solution.
However, keeping the real scale of the intersections in the model by means of \eqref{eqn:problem_2d_flux_avg}, we cut off the singularity peaks
at finite height and get rid of the singular solution part running to infinity.
Still there is left the problem of capturing the intersections and adjacent steep gradients in the solution by the numerical discretization.
This is the same motivation found in models in \cite{gracie_modelling_2010,craig_using_2011,koppl_vidotto_2018} and ours,
although treated very differently on the numerical level in each of the works.

\subsection{1d-3d Model}
In this model the aquifer domain is not reduced to a plane but it is represented as a~3d domain.
This would be a necessary consideration when the aquifer cannot be properly modeled in layers.
Let us denote the domain $\Omega_3$, we do not have the index $m$ here.
The boundary $\prtl\Omega_3 = \Gamma_{ext} \cup \Gamma_{int}$,
where the exterior boundary consists of two parts $\Gamma_{ext} = \Gamma_{3D} \cup \Gamma_{3N}$,
analogically to the 1d-2d model.

The interior boundary $\Gamma_{int}$ is created by an union of all the cross-sections of the domain $\Omega_3$
and wells lateral surfaces
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{int} = \bigcup_{\substack{w\in\mathcal{W}}} \Gamma_w, \quad \Gamma_w = \Omega_3 \cap \prtl\Omega^w_C.
\end{equation}
On $\Gamma_w$ we define the average decomposition $w = \avg{g}_w + \{g\}_w$ in the similar manner
as in the 1d-2d case. However, the average is computed over a circle edge, perpendicular to $\Omega^w_1$,
with its center at a~point $\nu_w(t)\in \Omega^w_1$
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:average_definition_3d}
    \avg{g}_w(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi\rho_w} \int_0^{2\pi} g (t + \rho_w \vc n_{\Omega^w_1}(t,\theta)) \rho_w \dd \theta.
\end{equation}
with $\vc n_{\Omega^w_1}(t,\theta)$ being the unit normal vector of $\Omega^w_1$ at point $\nu_w(t)$ in the direction
determined by the angle $\theta$.

Then we can write the entire problem:
\thmproblem{ \label{thm:problem_3d}
Find $[\vc u_1,\,\vc u_3]$ and $[p_1,\,p_3]$ satisfying
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
% \begin{alignat}{4}

\delta_d \vc K_d \grad p_d \cdot \vc n &= g_{dN} && \textrm{on } \Gamma_{dN},\; d=1,3 \label{eqn:problem_3d_neumann}
%   \end{alignat}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\[ 
{\color{blue}
    \Sigma_w(\vc x) = \delta_3\sigma_w(\vc x)\big(\avg{p_3}_w(\vc x)-p_1(\vc x)\big) \quad \vc x \in \Omega^w_1.

One can see the dimensional coupling terms highlighted in the blue color.
The term $\Sigma_w$, similarly to 1d-2d case, represents the flux from the aquifer $\Omega_3$ to the well $\Omega^w_1$.
The flux is proportional to the pressure difference with the (variable) permeability coefficient $\sigma_w(\vc x)>0\;[s^{-1}]$ between $\Omega_3$ and $\Omega^w_1$.
However, in contrast to the 1d-2d case, $\Sigma_w(\vc x)$, $\vc x\in\Omega^w_1$, varies through the well domain.
Analogically we can then read: the average outward flux from the aquifer at point $\vc x\in\Omega^w_1$
in \eqref{eqn:problem_3d_flux} acts as a~positive source term in the well in \eqref{eqn:problem_3d_1d_source}.
The last two equations are the boundary conditions, the first one \eqref{eqn:problem_3d_dirichlet} prescribes the boundary pressure $g_{dD}$, 
the later one \eqref{eqn:problem_3d_neumann} sets the inward flux $g_{dN}$ in the same manner as in 1d-2d case.
