Tato doktorská práce je zaměřena na řešení problému proudění podzemní vody v~porézním prostředí, které
je ovlivněno přítomností vrtů či studní. Model proudění je sestaven na základě konceptu redukce dimenzí,
který je hojně využíván při modelování rozpukaného porézního přostředí, především granitů.
Vrty jsou modelovány jako 1d objekty, které protínají blok horniny. 
Propojení těchto domén v redukovaném modelu způsobuje singularity v~řešení v~okolí vrtů.
Vrty i~porézní médium jsou síťovány nezávisle na sobě což vede k výpočetním sítím kombinujícím elementy
různých dimenzí.

Jádrem doktorské práce je pak vývoj specializované metody konečných prvků pro výše popsaný model. 
Pro umožnění propojení sítí různých dimenzí a pro zpřesnění aproximace singularit v okolí vrtů je 
použita rozšířená metoda konečných prvků (XFEM), v~rámci níž jsou navrženy nové typy obohacení
konečně-prvkové aproximace.
Metoda XFEM je nejprve aplikována v~modelu pro tlak, dále je navrženo obohacení pro rychlost a metoda
je použita ve smíšeném modelu, jehož řešením jsou rychlost i~tlak.

Doktorská práce se dále detailně věnuje numerickým aspektům v metodě XFEM, a~to především 
adaptivním kvadraturám, volbě velikosti obohacené oblasti nebo podmíněnosti výsledného lineárního systému.
Vlastnosti navržené XFEM metody a~optimální konvergence jsou ověřeny na sérii numerických experimentů.
Praktickým výstupem doktorské práce je implementace metody XFEM jako součásti open-source softwaru Flow123d.

\begin{abstractEN}
In this doctoral thesis, a~model of groundwater flow in porous media intersected with wells (boreholes, channels) is developed.
The model is motivated by the reduced dimension approach which is being often used in fractured porous media problems, especially in granite rocks.
The wells are modeled as lower dimensional 1d objects and they intersect the surrounding bulk rock domains.
The coupling between the wells and the rock then causes a~singular behaviour of the solution in the higher dimensional domains
in the vicinity of the cross-sections. The domains are discretized separately resulting in an~incompatible mesh of combined dimensions.

The core contribution of this work is in the developement of a~specialized finite element method for such model.
Different Extended finite element methods (XFEM) are studied and new enrichments are suggested to better
approximate the singularities and to enable the coupling of the wells with the higher dimensional domains.
At first the XFEM is applied in a~pressure model, later an enrichment for velocity
is suggested and the XFEM is used in a~mixed model, solving both velocity and pressure.

Different numerical aspects of the XFEM is studied in details, including an adaptive quadrature strategy,
a~proper choice of the enrichment zone or a~conditioning of the resulting linear system.
The properties of the suggested XFEM are validated on a~set of numerical tests and the optimal convergence
rate is demonstrated. The XFEM is implemented as a~part of the open-source software Flow123d.

Mathematical modelling plays a~very important role in science and also our daily lives throughout many different
fields of knowledge. Using modern finite element methods, we are able to simulate, investigate and predict
various phenomena of both nature and industrial character. Recent advances in the field of finite element methods
enable us to solve models of various scales, dimensions, to overcome numerical problems and also 
to couple interfering features together.

A large set of problems with finite element (FE) models, that people nowadays deal with, is connected with 
insufficient accuracy in cases where the model includes large and very small scale phenomena at once.
We can imagine a~simulation of groundwater flow in a~large domain (hundreds of meters) which can be significantly
influenced by thin fractures in the porous media or artificial wells and boreholes (several centimeters in diameter).
These disturbances bring discontinuities and singularities into the model and the finite elements are
unable to capture them accurately enough.

Adaptive meshes can be used in such cases, but it can cost a~lot of computational power to build a~very fine mesh,
and solve the problem with increasing number of degrees of freedom.
It also requires very robust meshing techniques when complex geometries are in question.

Alternatively, models combining different dimensions are being developed. These decompose the geometry
in objects of different dimension (e.g. 2D fractures, 1D wells, 0D point sources), create meshes of the objects independently,
and then they must deal with coupling of the modelled processes among the dimensions. 
Compatible meshes, where the intersections are at nodes and sides of elements, are easier to treat, but harder
or nearly impossible to construct in a~general case. On the other hand, incompatible meshes with arbitrary intersections are easier to construct, 
but bring a~whole new set of problems in the coupling.

Next, there are the so called extended finite element methods (XFEM); or partition of unity methods (PUM) or generalized
finite element methods (GFEM), which names are sometimes used interchangeably. 
These methods enable us to take advantage of an a~priori knowledge of the model solution character.
Then, we are able to locally incorporate non-polynomial functions, like a~jump or a~singularity, into the finite element solution
 in places, where we expect these features to appear. See an example of XFEM usage in 0D-2D coupling in \fig{fig:aquifers}.

          (vertical lines). The XFEM is used on a~coarse mesh (at the bottom). }
  \label{fig:aquifers}
\end{figure}

The thesis is aimed at further development of the XFEM and its usage in multidimensional models. 
We intend to create a~model with incompatible mesh, where elements of different dimensions intersect
arbitrarily, and then use the XFEM to glue the processes in different dimensions back together. 
This of course is a~very ambitious idea, therefore we narrow our plan to 0D-2D and 1D-3D coupling. 

Our research domain is groundwater modelling, therefore we apply the method on such model.
There are, of course, various other applications for such models apart from groundwater flow and transport in fractured porous media:
geothermal problematic and gathering geothermal energy; oil and gas extraction and also gas storage;
construction of safe underground nuclear waste deposits; investigation of transport of substances in human body
and more.

\section{Flow123d} \label{sec:soa_flow123d}

The software Flow123d (latest stable version 1.8.2 in 2015, online documentation in \cite{flow123d_doc_2015}) 
is a~simulator of underground water flow, solute and heat transport in fractured porous media. The software is
developed as an open source code under the versioning system Git where the eponymous project can be found, or 
one can find it on the web page
\begin{center}
\url{http://flow123d.github.io/}
\end{center}
It has been developed at the Technical University of Liberec approximately since 2007.
The main feature of the software is a~computation on complex compatible meshes of combined dimensions, described in
previous section. Therefore, the continuum models and discrete fracture network models can be combined.

  \caption{Logo of Flow123d.}
  \label{fig:logo_flow123d}
\end{figure}
%
Current version includes mixed-hybrid solver for steady and unsteady Darcy flow, finite volume model 
and discontinuous Galerkin model for solute transport of several substances and heat transfer model. 
Using operator splitting, models for various local processes are supported including dual porosity, sorption, decays 
and simple reactions.


Development of the software is an important practical part of the thesis. The aim is to implement support 
of incompatible meshes in the Darcy flow model. More details about implementation goals will be given in
Section \ref{chap:aims}.

% The actuality of these themes is demonstrated by the several conferences with attendants from all over the world.
% We mention the X-DMS (eXtended Discretization Methods), are being held since 2013 including the preceding  XFEM conferences.
% The main topics includes the state-of-art methods for discretization of complex problems on complex domains, with a stress
% on XFEM methods.
% The other conference if DFNE focused on everything concerning the discrete fracture network with main interest in geology.


\section{Aims of the Thesis}\label{chap:aims}
% define aims, characterize and briefly explain solution

The research aims of the thesis can be summarized in two major points
\begin{itemize}
  \item Propose suitable enrichments for the pressure and the velocity that are stable (satisfy inf-sup condition). 
        If possible, emphasise a~good approximation of the velocity field which is necessary for the transport equation.
        
  \item Suggest new data structures and algorithms for the realization phase in the software Flow123d. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research aims}

The following types of enrichments can be considered: wells (point source in 2D, line source in 3D), 
fractures (discontinuity in velocity), boundary of 1D and 2D fractures. 
To narrow the ambitious plan, we will focus on the enrichment for 0D-2D and 1D-3D interactions.

The model with the mixed-hybrid formulation as in \cite{brezina_mixed-hybrid_2010, sistek_bddc_2015} will be followed.
The enrichment will be chosen and incorporated in the formulation so that the singularities in 0D-2D and
1D-3D are better approximated and incompatible meshes can be used. 
We shall start by enriching the pressure field with a~logarithmic function like we
do in Section \ref{sec:model_aquifer} and investigate the consequences in the mixed and mixed-hybrid formulation.

Secondly the velocity field will be enriched. We will look for a~proper vectorial enrichment functions.
The accuracy of the velocity field, in particular the flow across the elements edges, is very important for
the transport equation which is in the main focus in most of the applications.

In a consequence of the enrichment, the discrete spaces will be extended. The influence of the enrichment on the inf-sup 
condition will be investigated and the proof of stability for the enriched formulation should be provided.
The aim is to understand the stability condition good enough so that some constraints on the choice of the enrichment 
functions can be defined. 

The realization of the model in the means of code implementation will require several non-standard techniques.
Efficient data structure must be provided for the enrichment implementation in finite element classes.
The intersections of the mesh domains of different dimensions must be computed. A specialized integration
on the intersected elements is needed to assembly the integrals in the system matrix. 
Solving the final linear algebraic system will require an efficient numerical method.
Each of these sub-problems is not trivial and requires a new approach or at least extending the existing one.
The steps of the realization are summarized below in Section \ref{sec:realization}.

\subsection{Realization} \label{sec:realization}
The suggested numerical model will be implemented and tested in the software Flow123d.
The following upgrades and changes are to be considered.

The enrichment functions need to be defined and support for the enrichment in the finite element classes must be implemented. 
A class that handles the degrees of freedom must be then updated to include the additional enriched degrees of freedom
and the structure of the linear system must be reorganized accordingly.

The enriched elements are in 3D domain. A module in Flow123d that is able to lookup the element intersections
of different dimensions is now being finished (see Chapter \ref{chap:intersections}). The enrichment will propagate from the intersected 3D elements.
The choice of the size of the enrichment area is not straightforward. In case of discontinuities, one layer of elements
near the discontinuity would be suitable, but in case of singularity, the area must be large enough so that 
the large gradients in the quantities are well approximated. For simplicity, the area size can be given as
a~constant parameter.

Then the assembly routines of the enriched terms into the linear system must be provided.
Since the enrichment function would not be polynomial, accurate integration on the enriched elements is required. 
The adaptive elements sub-refinement approach can be used to obtain more precise quadrature, 
or quadrature points defined in cylindrical coordinate system in the vicinity of 1D elements intersections
might be suitable in this case.

Finally, a~reasonable output post-processing should be developed, so that the XFEM solution (piecewise non-polynomial solution)
can be visualized properly. A~kind of adaptive refinement of the output mesh would be suitable.

\chapter{Summary} \label{chap:summary}
% closure - what is done, further plan, mention traineeship

Based on the research of the related works in Chapter \ref{chap:soa} and the experience gained at the conferences
(in particular X-DMS '15 and MAMERN VI), we are convinced that this is an interesting hot topic which deserves
our attention. On the other hand, we are not aware of any closely connected work to this topic in the Czech Republic
which puts us in a pioneer position at least in the Czech scientific environment.

The aims of the thesis are stated in the Chapter \ref{chap:aims} and these are both of theoretic and practical nature.
There is a lot work to do in the code implementation part but some of the work has been done already 
(Chapter \ref{chap:intersections}). The rest will be done, possibly with some support of the Flow123d development team. 

So far, we studied the well-aquifer model (Section \ref{sec:model_aquifer}). We compared several different XFEM methods, 
dealt with the integration accuracy and investigated some other aspects of the XFEM usage. The results
of our work were presented at several conferences and concluded in an article (list in Chapter \ref{chap:publications}).

A 6 months long traineeship is planned for the second half of the year 2016. A cooperation with the team lead
by professor Barbara Wohlmuth at the Technical University in Munich is to be established. They are experts
in the field of porous media modelling and they are also interested in models on meshes with combined dimensions
(see e.g. \cite{schwenck_2015} where fracture intersections in 2D is solved). The aim of the traineeship is to
work together both on the theory and implementation of the XFEM in 0D-2D and 1D-3D flow model.
