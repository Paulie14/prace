% In this chapter, we shall describe the work that has already been done. First part (Section \ref{sec:model_aquifer}) 
% is regarding a~model of a~well-aquifer system where the XFEM is applied to resolve a~point singularity in 2D domain. 
% The second part (Section \ref{sec:elements_intersections}) is aimed at a~geometrical problem of finding 
% intersections of incompatible meshes of different dimensions.

\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:summary}
% closure - what is done, further plan, mention traineeship

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Based on the research of the related works and the experience gained at the conferences
(in particular MAMERN VI '15, X-DMS '15-17 and CMWR '18),
we are convinced that we dedicated our efforts to a~very interesting and hot topic with wide range of applications.
We are not aware of any closely connected work to this topic in the Czech Republic
which puts us in a pioneer position at least in the Czech scientific environment.

% The aims of the thesis are stated in the Chapter \ref{chap:aims} and these are both of theoretic and practical nature.
% There is a lot work to do in the code implementation part but some of the work has been done already 
% (Chapter \ref{chap:intersections}). The rest will be done, possibly with some support of the Flow123d development team. 


The work was also consulted during the traineeship at Technical University in Munich at the Department of Numerical Mathematics
lead by Prof. Barbara Wholmuth. Mainly the theoretical aspects of the work and new ideas were discussed.
We got also familiarized with a~different approach for modeling singularities without using XFEM, which is being developed there.


% Multi-level Monte Carlo methods - computation on coarse meshes - can include non-planar 1d-2d or 1d-3d intersections 
% on coarse meshes using the XFEM.

% So far, we studied the well-aquifer model (Section \ref{sec:model_aquifer}). We compared several different XFEM methods, 
% dealt with the integration accuracy and investigated some other aspects of the XFEM usage. The results
% of our work were presented at several conferences and concluded in an article (list in Chapter \ref{chap:publications}).

A 6 months long traineeship is planned for the second half of the year 2016. A cooperation with the team lead
by professor Barbara Wohlmuth at the Technical University in Munich is to be established. They are experts
in the field of porous media modelling and they are also interested in models on meshes with combined dimensions
(see e.g. \cite{schwenck_2015} where fracture intersections in 2D is solved). The aim of the traineeship is to
work together both on the theory and implementation of the XFEM in 0D-2D and 1D-3D flow model.
