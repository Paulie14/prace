\section{Model of Well-Aquifer System} 
\label{sec:model_aquifer}
The content of this section is based on our publication \cite{exner_2016}. Some problems with convergence addressed in the article
have been solved since its accepting, the test problem has been modified and also an alternative integration technique
using polar coordinates has been suggested.

The implementation has been done in C++ language using the Deal II~\cite{bangerth_deal.ii_2007}, 
the finite element library not supporting any enrichment techniques at the moment.

\subsection{Model equations}
We consider a~steady groundwater flow in a~system of aquifers (2D models of horizontal geological layers) separated by aquitards
(based on Gracie and Craig \cite{gracie_modelling_2010,craig_using_2011}).
In contrast to Gracie and Craig, we suppose the aquitards to be impermeable, 
however we add an artificial volume source term. This allows us to better study the impact of 
the prescribed source on the solution which is better suited to the numerical experiments we are focused on. 

The aquifers are then connected only through the wells 
which act as sources or sinks in the domain of each aquifer. The pressure in the aquifers is further governed 
by a~Dirichlet boundary condition on the outer boundary of every aquifer.

The model is defined as a~complex multi-aquifer system to follow our implementation and to see the differences
we made in comparison to Gracie and Craig. Although later, we consider mostly just single aquifer.

Let $\Theta^m\subset \Real^2$ be the domain of the $m$-th aquifer, $m=1,\ldots M$.
The well $w\in\mathcal{W}=\{1,\ldots,W\}$ is represented by an infinite vertical cylinder $B_w$
with center $\bx_w$ and radius $\rho_w$.  We further denote 
\[
 B^m_w = B_w \cap \Theta^m, \quad \text{and} \quad
 B^m=\bigcup_{w\in \mathcal{W}}B^m_w,
\]
for any aquifer $m$ and a~well $w$.
The actual computational domain of the aquifer $m$ is $\Omega^m = \Theta^m\setminus B^m$. The boundary $\partial\Omega^m$ of 
the domain consists of the exterior part $\partial\Theta^m=\Gamma^m_D$ and the interior part $\partial B^m$.


Combining the Darcy law and the continuity equation for incompressible fluid, we get
a Poisson equation for the pressure head in the $m$-th aquifer:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:poisson}
\nabla\cdot(-\mathbf{T}^m\nabla h^m) = f^m \qquad \textrm{on } \Omega^m\subset\Real^2,\; \forall m=1,\dots,M, \\
\end{equation}
which has to be supplied with boundary conditions
\begin{align}
h^m|_{\Gamma^m_D} &= h^m_D, \\
\label{eq:interior_bc}
\left(-\mathbf{T}^m\nabla h^m\cdot\vc{n}\right)|_{\partial B^m_w} &= \sigma^m_w(\langle h^m \rangle - H^m_w) \qquad \forall w\in\mathcal{W},
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{T}^m\, [\textrm{m}^2\textrm{s}^{-1}]$ denotes the transmissivity tensor,
%(we will further consider only scalar $T^m$ for simplicity), 
$h^m\, [\textrm{m}]$ is the pressure head, $f^m\, [\textrm{m}\textrm{s}^{-1}]$ stands for the source density,
$\vc{n}$ is the unit outer normal vector of the interior boundary (i.e. pointing to the centers of wells),
$\sigma^m_w\, [\textrm{m}\textrm{s}^{-1}]$ denotes the permeability coefficient between $w$-th well and 
$m$-th aquifer, and finally $H_w^m$ is the pressure head in the well $w$ at the level of $m$-th aquifer.

%
The average value of pressure head along the well edge $\langle{h^m}\rangle$ is defined as
\[\langle{h^m}\rangle = \fint_{\partial B_w} h^m  \dd\bx.\]
The boundary condition with the average pressure head $\langle{h^m}\rangle$ forces the gradient
of the pressure head to constant.

The total flow from the well $w$ to aquitard $m$,
\[
    Q^m_w =-\int_{\prtl B^m_w} \sigma^m_w(\langle h^m \rangle - H^m_w)  \dd\bx
\]
satisfies a~simple balance equation on the well
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:well_flow}
    Q_w^m = Q^m_{w,in} - Q^m_{w,out} = c^{m+1}_w\left( H^{m+1}_w-H^m_w \right) - c_w^m\left( H^m_w-H_w^{m-1}\right),&\\
    \notag
    \forall\,m=1,\dots,M\text{ and }\forall\,w\in\mathcal{W},&
\end{align}
where $Q^m_{w,in}$ is the flow from the upper aquifer $m+1$, $Q^m_{w,out}$ is the flow to the lower aquifer $m-1$, and 
$c^m_w\, [\textrm{m}^2\textrm{s}^{-1}]$ is the permeability of the well $w$ in the segment below the aquifer $m$.

%
In \eqref{eq:well_flow}, we assume Darcy flow in the well for the simplicity. The bottom of the well $w$ is impermeable,
we set $c^1_w=0$, $H^0_w=H^1_w$ there, and we prescribe given pressure $H^{M+1}_w$ at the top.

\subsection{Weak formulation}
We define the trial space $V$ and the test space $V_0$:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:spaces}
  V &=& \left(H^1(\Omega^m)\right)^M\times\Real^{W(M+1)}, \\
  V_0 &=& \left(H^1_0(\Omega^m)\right)^M\times\Real^{WM},
\end{eqnarray}
where $H^1(\Omega^m)$ is the standard Sobolev space and 
\[ H^1_0(\Omega^m)=\{\varphi\in H^1(\Omega^m); \varphi|_{\Gamma^m_D}=0\}. \]
We can now introduce the weak solution $u$ and the test function $v$
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:solution}
   u &=& (h^1,\ldots, h^M, H^1_1,\ldots,H^{M+1}_W)\in V, \\
   v &=& (\varphi^1,\ldots, \varphi^M, \Phi^1_1,\ldots,\Phi^M_W)\in V_0.
\end{eqnarray}
We understand $V_0$ as a~subspace of $V$ setting $\Phi^{M+1}_W=0$.

To obtain the weak form, we apply the standard Galerkin method. We multiply the equation \eqref{eqn:poisson} 
by a~test function $\varphi^m$ and integrate by parts over $\Omega^m$, for all $m=1,\ldots,M$, to get
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:weak_form1}
  \int_{\Omega^m} T^m \nabla h^m \cdot \nabla \varphi^m \dd\bx
  + \sum_{w\in \mathcal{W}} \int_{\partial B^m_w} \sigma^m_w (\langle h^m \rangle - H_w^m) \varphi^m \dd\bx
  = \int_{\Omega^m} f^m\varphi^m \dd\bx.
  % - \int \limits_{\Omega^m} T^m \nabla h^m_D \nabla v^m \dd\mathbf{x},
\end{equation}
%
We then multiply \eqref{eq:well_flow} by $\Phi^m_w$, add it to \eqref{eqn:weak_form1} 
and sum up over $m$ which results in
\begin{multline} \label{eqn:weak_form}
  \sum_{m=1}^M \; \int_{\Omega^m} T^m \nabla h^m \cdot \nabla \varphi^m \dd\bx
        + \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{w\in \mathcal{W}} \; 
           \int_{\partial B^m_w} \sigma^m_w\left(\langle h^m \rangle-H^m_w\right)\left(\langle \varphi^m \rangle -\Phi^m_w\right) \dd\bx \\
        + \sum_{m=1}^{M+1} \sum_{w\in\mathcal{W}}
          c_w^{m}\left( H^{m}_w-H_w^{m-1}\right)\left(\Phi^{m}_w - \Phi^{m-1}_w\right)           
  = \sum_{m=1}^M \; \int_{\Omega^m} f^m\varphi^m \dd\bx.   
\end{multline}
% \noteJB{Consider sum over aquifers to get square term from communication on wells.
% Boundary conditions on wells?}
We say that $u\in V$ is a~weak solution if it satisfies \eqref{eqn:weak_form} for all $v\in V_0$. 
Putting $h^m=\varphi^m$ and $H^m_w=\Phi^m_w$, we can clearly see the elliptic character of all terms on the 
left hand side of the weak form \eqref{eqn:weak_form} in the whole test space $V_0$. The existence and uniqueness of the solution can be shown 
via the Lax-Milgram lemma due to ellipticity and boundedness of the problem.

\subsection{Discretization}
\label{sec:discretization}
We can now proceed to the choice of the enrichment and discretization of the equation \eqref{eqn:weak_form}.
In this section as well as in the rest of the paper, we shall consider only one aquifer for the sake of simplicity
so we can omit the upper index $m$. Extension to the multi-aquifer system is straightforward. 
In particular, the space of shape functions is same on every aquifer since we consider 
the same triangulation for every aquifer in our implementation. 
Namely, we use regular square grid.

\subsubsection{Enrichment function}
The enrichment function can be obtained from the solution of a~local problem on the neighbourhood of the well $w$.
Let $\Omega_w$ be an annulus with center $\vc x_w$ inner radius $\rho_w$ and arbitrary outer radius $D \gg \rho$.
Solution of the Laplace equation $-T \Delta h = 0$ on $\Omega_w$ with any radially symmetric boundary conditions has a~form
%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:solution_form}
  h = a \log(r_w)+b, %\quad \textrm{where }
\end{equation}
where $r_w$ is a~distance function
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:distance}
r_w(\bx) = \|\\bx - \bx_w\|= \sqrt{(x-x_w)^2+(y-y_w)^2}.
\end{equation}
%
Thus the pressure head would go to infinity while closing to the center of the well.
Keeping in mind the radius of the well $\rho_w$ and the local solution \eqref{eqn:solution_form}, 
we introduce a~(global) enrichment function
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:enrich_func}
s_w(\bx) = 
  \begin{cases}
  \log(r_w(\bx)) & r_w > \rho_w,\\
  \log(\rho_w) & r_w \le \rho_w.\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
See \fig{fig:enrich_func}.
It is natural to use the same $s_w$ on each aquifer since it depends only on $r_w$ and the wells have constant center and radius along the $x$-axis
(we consider only vertical wells, perpendicular to aquifers).
%
% and its gradient
% \begin{equation} \label{eqn:xgrad_func}
% \nabla s_w(\bx) = 
%   \begin{cases}  
%     \frac{\bx - \bx_w}{r_w^2(\bx)} & r_w>R_w \\
%     0 & r_w \leq R_w
%   \end{cases}.
% \end{equation}

  \label{fig:enrich_func}
\end{figure}


In contrast to global enrichment methods, the XFEM and the SGFEM apply the enrichment functions only locally. 
Since the enrichment function is radial, it is natural to consider the enriched domain $Z_w = B_{R_w}(\vc x_w)$
of the well $w$ given by the enrichment radius $R_w$. Local enrichment methods enrich only 
nodes that are in the enriched domain of at least one well.

\subsubsection{Partition of unity methods}
\label{sec:pum_methods}
Let $N_\alpha(\bx)$, $\alpha\in\mathcal{I}=\{1,\ldots,N\}$ be the standard linear finite element shape 
functions associated with the node $\bx_\alpha$ of the triangulation. 
In the \textbf{standard XFEM}, we write the solution in the form
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:xfem_standard_form}
  h(\bx) = \sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}a_\alpha N_\alpha(\bx)
    + \sum_{w\in\mathcal{W}} \sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}^e_w} b_{\alpha w} \phi_{\alpha w}(\bx),
\end{equation}
where $a_\alpha$ are the standard FE degrees of freedom and $b_{\alpha w}$ are the degrees of freedom coming from
the enrichment of the well $w$. The index set $\mathcal{I}^e_w$ includes all nodes enriched by the well $w$; on the other hand, 
at one node one can have several enrichment functions originating from different wells.
The local enrichment functions $\phi_{\alpha w}$ in \eqref{eqn:xfem_standard_form} are defined
in the following way
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:xfem_enrich}
    \phi_{\alpha w} = N_\alpha(\bx)L_{\alpha w}(\bx), \quad \alpha\in\mathcal{I}^e_w, w\in\mathcal{W},
\end{equation}
where the enrichment function is simply $L_{\alpha w}(\bx) = s_w(\bx)$.

\subsubsection{Corrected XFEM}
The corrected XFEM, introduced in  \cite{fries_corrected_2008}, deals with the convergence problem on blending elements
which are elements on the boundary of the enriched zone that contains both enriched and unenriched nodes.
The corrected XFEM introduces the \textbf{ramp function}
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:ramp_function}
  G_w(\bx) &=& \sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}_w^e} N_\alpha(\bx)    \\
  &=& 
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \textrm{ on unenriched elements,}    \\
    1 & \textrm{ on elements where all nodes are enriched,}    \\
    ramp & \textrm{ on elements where some of the nodes are enriched.}    \\
  \end{cases} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
It also extends the set of the enriched nodes of the well $w$, denoted by $\mathcal{J}^e_w$, by enriching also (previously unenriched) nodes 
of the blending elements of the well $w$. Thus $\mathcal{I}^e_w\subset\mathcal{J}^e_w$.
The enrichment function changes into the form
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:xfem_ramp}
    L_{\alpha w} = G_w(\bx) s_{w}(\bx), \quad \alpha\in\mathcal{J}^e, w\in\mathcal{W}.
\end{equation}


In the same work, i.e. \cite{fries_corrected_2008}, authors further suggest the \textbf{shifted} enrichment functions in order 
to preserve the property of the standard 
FE approximation at nodes $h(\bx_\alpha)=a_\alpha$: the value at the node is equal to the corresponding degree
of freedom. The enrichment functions must be then zero at the nodes which is satisfied in the form
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:xfem_shift}
    L_{\alpha w} = G_w(\bx) \left[s_w(\bx) - s_w(\bx_\alpha)\right],
    \quad \alpha\in\mathcal{J}^e, w\in\mathcal{W}.
\end{equation} 
The property of the shifted formulation enables us to prescribe Dirichlet boundary condition such that
$a_\alpha = h_D(\bx_\alpha)$.

It has been also shown in many cases that both ramp function and shifting are needed to obtain optimal convergence rate.
In \cite{ventura_fast_2009}, authors analyse a~more general form of a~ramp function (calling the method a~weighted XFEM)
and compare different alternatives of shifting on crack and dislocation problems. The methods described above can be then seen
as special types of the weighted XFEM. Let us call them the \textbf{ramp function XFEM}  
and the \textbf{shifted XFEM} for the purpose of this article, as we shall reference to them later.

\subsubsection{SGFEM}
Finally, we present the \textbf{SGFEM}, according to \cite{babuska_stable_2012,gupta_stable_2013}. 
The enrichment function is defined as the subtraction of the global enrichment function and its interpolation 
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:sgfem_enrich}
    L_{\alpha w}|_{\tau} = \left[s_w(\bx) - \pi_\tau (s_w)(\bx)\right],
    \quad \alpha\in\mathcal{I}^e_w, w\in\mathcal{W}.
\end{equation} 
for any element $\tau$ of the mesh that have at least one enriched node.
The interpolation $\pi_\tau$ is built using the finite element shape functions
associated with nodes $\mathcal{I}(\tau)$ of the element $\tau$
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:sgfem_interpolation}
    \pi_\tau (s_w)(\bx) = \sum_{\beta\in\mathcal{I}(\tau)} s_w(\bx_\beta) N_\beta(\bx).
    %\quad \textrm{ on } \tau,\; \alpha\in\mathcal{I}^e, w\in\mathcal{W}.
\end{equation}
Notice that there are no additional enriched nodes on blending elements, like in $\mathcal{J}^e$ in 
\eqref{eqn:xfem_ramp} and \eqref{eqn:xfem_shift}, and no ramp function is involved.


\subsection{Integration on enriched elements}
\label{sec:integration}
In order to compute the entries of the system matrix, %\eqref{eqn:s_entry} and \eqref{eqn:r_entry} 
we need to integrate
the expressions containing the enrichment functions. These of course can be non-polynomial, like they are 
in our case. The standard quadrature rules are not appropriate any more, for they are constructed to integrate 
precisely only polynomials up to a~given degree. The higher requirements on the integration precision
are the price for using enrichment functions and a~coarse mesh.

There are two aspects which the integration must handle properly:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the steep gradient of enrichment base functions in the vicinity of the well (the singularity),
  \item the well edge geometry, since we need to integrate only outside of the well.
\end{itemize}

One of the approaches to deal with these requirements is an adaptive quadrature. The element is divided into 
subregions (squares on the reference element) only to place more quadrature points inside but not to bring 
any more degrees of freedom into the system. In this section we will discuss the adaptivity rules, 
suggest an improvement and compare our strategy to the original one (developed in \cite{gracie_modelling_2010}).

\subsubsection{Instability of adaptive quadrature}
\label{sec:refinement_element}
Gracie and Craig in \cite{gracie_modelling_2010} refine only subregions that cross the boundary of the well, using at most 12 refinements.
This catches nicely the well edge but it works only when the well is placed at the node of an element or near the center of an element. 
When the well is placed near the edge of an element, there can be
a large difference in the size of neighbouring subregions, see \fig{fig:adapt_ref_a}. Although
the integrand is computed precisely enough on the element with the well inside, the quadrature points on the
neighbouring elements (where the integrand has still large derivatives) are placed very sparsely 
and the integration error is large.

   edge is blue.
  }
  \label{fig:adapt_refinement}
\end{figure}
In order to overcome this instability of the adaptive quadrature, we have made an asymptotic analysis of the integration error presented 
in the next section.

\subsubsection{Estimate of quadrature error}

Let us assume only one well of radius $\rho$ situated at the origin. In the case of elliptic equation, the term with the strongest singularity is 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:term-of-interest}
    f(r)=(\nabla \log r )^2 \approx r^{-2}
\end{equation}
which is also the worst term to integrate independently of the particular variant of the PU method.
Consider a~square subregion $S$ with a~side $\delta$ and 
let us denote $r_{S}$ its distance from the origin.
We want to estimate the error of the 2D tensor product Gauss quadrature rule of order $n$ ($n$ times $n$ points) on the square $S$. 
Let us denote 
$\Pi^n f$ the projection of the integrand $f$ to the space of polynomials that are integrated exactly.
We were not able to find error estimates for 2D quadratures in the literature and deriving them would be extremely technical.
However, we can make an observation that among the squares of the same $r_{S}$, the quadrature error is the highest for the squares laying on one of the axis.
Assume without loose of generality a~square on the $X$-axis. Since $\abs{y}<\delta \ll \abs{x}$, the monomials of $\Pi^n f$ containing $y$ 
are negligible and we get the quadrature
of order $n$ in the radial ($X$-axis) direction. On the other hand for the square on the diagonal, the bilinear terms of 
a 2D quadrature effectively enhance its order to $2n$ in the radial (diagonal) direction. Due to the radial nature of the integrand,
we can estimate the quadrature error on the square $S$ by the error on the square $S'$ with the same $r_S$ laying on the $X$-axis, then we can 
neglect $y$~monomials and use the error estimates for the 1D quadrature:
\[
  \int_S \abs{f-\Pi^n f} \dd\bx \le \int_{S'}\abs{f-\Pi^n f} \dd\bx \le \delta E^n((r_{S}, r_{S}+\delta)).
\]
The $E_n$ is the error of 1D Gauss quadrature of the order $n$ ($n$ quadrature points) over the interval $(r,r+\delta)$
\[
  E_n = \frac{\delta^{2n+1} (n!)^4}{(2n+1)((2n)!)^3} f^{(2n)}(\xi_n) 
\]
for some $\xi_n \in (r, r+\delta)$, see e.g. \cite{kahaner_numerical_1989}. 
The expression $f^{(2n)}$ denotes a~derivative of order $2n$ of a~function $f$.
Regarding the integrand \eqref{eq:term-of-interest}, we have 
\[
  \abs{f^{(2n)}(r)} = (2n+1)! r^{-(2n+2)}.
\]
Finally, we get an estimate for the quadrature error on a~single subregion:
\[
    \int_S \abs{f-\Pi^n f}  \dd\bx \le  \alpha_n \left( \frac{\delta}{r_{S}} \right)^{2n+2}, 
  \qquad \alpha_n = \left( \frac{(n!)^2}{(2n)!} \right)^2.
\]
This estimate implies that we have to ensure $\delta < r_S$ in order to get a~decent quadrature error 
and possibly to employ a~higher order quadrature. 


%JB%Derived criterion holds only on squares, where the integrated function is smooth.
%JB%This is not the case for squares intersecting the boundary of the well, $r_{S} \le \rho \le r_{max}$, where we integrate

%JB%
%\noteJB{TODO: modify test of integration on unit disk for the function $1/r^2$.}

\subsubsection{A priori adaptive quadrature rules}
Let us denote $r_{min}$ the minimum and $r_{max}$ the maximum distance to the center of a~well from a~subregion. 
Based on the analysis presented above, we propose following adaptive quadrature rules:
%JB%\begin{enumerate}
%JB% \item If $r_{max} < \rho$ the square quadrature is zero.
%JB% \item If $r_{min} < \rho < r_{max}$ (square cross the well boundary) we subdivide the square unless $\delta < 2^{-12}h$.
%JB% \item If $r_{min} > \rho$. For $\frac{h}{r_{min}} > \frac{1}{2}$ subdivide the square, else select order $n$ so that 
%JB% \begin{equation} \label{eqn:alpha_criterion}
%JB%    \frac{\alpha_n h^{2n}}{r_{min}^{2n+2}} \le \epsilon,
%JB% \end{equation}
%JB% use at least the same order as necessary for FEM.
%JB%\end{enumerate}
%JB%
%\noteJB{TODO:
%We should estimate true error numerically using one more subdivision and compare it to prescribed tolerance, we should be safely 
%below, without increasing the number of evaluation compared to current implementation.
%}



%JB%We suggest additional criterion for subelements refinement which takes into account a subelement diameter 
%JB%and its distance from the well
%JB%\begin{equation}
%JB%  h \leq C_R r_{min},
%JB%\end{equation}
%JB%\notePE{Originally, I compute $r_{min}$ between vertices and the well center, but I believe that the results would be the same.}
%JB%where $h$ is the diameter of the subelement and $r_{min}$ is the minimal distance between a vertex of 
%JB%the subelement and the well center. $C_R$ is a scaling constant, equal 0.5 by default, through which we can 
%JB%control the significance of the criterion. If satisfied, the subelement is not refined anymore.
%JB%

%JB%Eventually, we do 10 levels of improved adaptive refinement with the following rules ($r_{max}$ is the maximal
%JB%distance of a vertex of the subelement and the well center):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $r_{max} < \rho$, the subregion is not refined and the quadrature is zero.
 \item If $r_{min} < \rho < r_{max}$ and $\delta > 2^{-10}h$, the subregion is refined.
 \item If $r_{min} < \rho < r_{max}$ and $\delta \le 2^{-10}h$, $3\times3$ Gauss quadrature is used.
 The values at quadrature points lying inside the well are set to zero.
 \item If $r_{min} > \rho$ and $\delta > r_{min} / 2$, the subregion is refined.
 \item If $r_{min} > \rho$ and $\delta \le r_{min} / 2$, $3\times3$ Gauss quadrature is used.
\end{enumerate}


These rules ensure $\delta < r_{min}/2$ outside the well, where the integrand is smooth. Subregions intersecting 
the well's boundary are refined using at most $10$ refinement levels, since the integrand is discontinuous there and we cannot employ 
estimates from the previous section. The maximum number of levels is chosen so that we get the similar total number of quadrature points 
as in the quadrature used by Gracie and Craig in \cite{gracie_modelling_2010}. Using the proposed rules, the elements that do not contain the well are refined as well,
see \fig{fig:adapt_ref_b}. 

Implementation of this approach allows the convergence rates of the used PU methods to close up to the optimum,
as the results of the numerical tests will show in section \ref{sec:results}.

\subsubsection{Quadrature in polar coordinates}

The idea for the usage of the quadrature in polar coordinates originates from the radial character of the terms
that are integrated. 
The motivation is to reduce the number of quadrature points (refinement levels) of the previously described quadrature due to
precise representation of the well edge and/or increase of accuracy.

We define a~circular neighbourhood of a~well, i.e. a~band of width $\gamma$ (see \fig{fig:well_band}),
\[ \mathcal{P} = \{\vc{x}: \rho < \abs{\vc{x} - \vc{x}_w} < \rho + \gamma \}.\]
Next we define a~smooth step function (see \fig{fig:smooth_step})
\[\mu(z) = -2 z^3 +3 z^2,\quad z=\frac{r-\rho}{\gamma}.\]%
%
\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \vspace{-35pt}

  \subfloat[well neighbourhood $\mathcal{P}$]{\label{fig:well_band} 
          \def\svgwidth{0.35\textwidth}

  }
  \caption[Smooth step function]
  {Smooth step function $\mu$ on the well neighbourhood $\mathcal{P}$.
  }
  \label{fig:smooth_step_well_band}
\end{figure}    

We use $\mu$ as a~partition of unity to divide an integral into 2 parts
\begin{eqnarray} 
      \int\limits_S v(\mathbf{x}) \dd \mathbf{x} &=& \int\limits_S \mu(r) v(\mathbf{x}) \dd \mathbf{x} + \int\limits_S (1-\mu(r)) v(\mathbf{x}) \dd \mathbf{x} \nonumber\\
      &=& \int\limits_S \mu(r) v(\mathbf{x}) \dd \mathbf{x} + \int\limits_0^{2\pi} \int\limits_\rho^{\rho+\gamma} (1-\mu(r)) v(\mathbf{x}) r \dd r \dd \phi.
\end{eqnarray}
We see that the first integral vanishes when closing to the well edge, while the second grows. This corresponds
to the character of the solution which is more radial in the vicinity of the well rather than far away from it.
Therefore we transform the second integral into polar coordinates $\mathbf{x} \longleftrightarrow (r,\phi)$. 
The first integral is computed using the previously described quadrature, but with much less refinement
levels, since the well edge is now represented precisely (see \fig{fig:polar_quad_points} with
an example of quadrature points distribution).

The adaptive integration in polar coordinates has been implemented and tested.
However, the results of are not satisfying as expected. The quadrature accuracy is very dependent on the choice of
the band width around the well, position of the well relative to nodes of the mesh and also to the size of nearby elements.
When playing long enough with the setting, an optimal convergence rate can be reached, but no general and robust 
setting has been found. The problematic would need a~deeper investigation and we leave it open for now, since
we can still use the previously described quadrature.


%JB%\subsection{Adaptive integration experiment}
%JB%We now describe the experiment from which we obtained the coefficients in the criterion 
%JB%\eqref{eqn:h_criterion}. Let us have a single element, a square $4\times4$, out of which a circle of unit radius 
%JB%is cut off -- this represents an element with a well. We now want to investigate integration error
%JB%in the vicinity of the circle on the function $f=r^{-2}$, $r$ being the distance from the center of the circle. 
%JB%
%JB%We compute the integral on the selected level of refinement only on the squares intersecting the circle. Then

%JB%that it is more efficient to refine one more level with one-point quadrature than to use higher order 
%JB%quadrature on the coarser level. As for the coefficient, these can be read from the graph -- for the one point
%JB%quadrature $c_e=12.65$ and $p_e=1.27$.

\subsection{Estimate of the enrichment radius} \label{sec:enrichemnt_radius}
In this section, we shall study the dependence of the solution error on the enrichment radius $R$. First part is devoted to 
theoretical analysis, the later part presents numerical results.
Let us consider a~general elliptic problem to find $u\in V$ satisfying
\[
   a(u, \phi) = \langle f, \phi \rangle, \text{ for } \phi \in V,
\]
where $a$ is bounded elliptic bilinear form: $\norm{a}\le M_a$, $a(v, v) \ge \gamma \norm{v}_V^2$, $\gamma>0$, and $f$ a~bounded linear form, $f\in V'$. 
Suppose, that the problem is to be solved on a~domain $\Omega \subset \Real^2$ with a~single hole (well) of radius $\rho$ at the origin. 
Let us assume, that the solution can be split into the singular part $u_s(\vc x)= \log |\vc x|$ and the regular part $u_r=u-u_s$.
Let $V^P_h$ be a~polynomial finite element subspace of $V$ on a~regular mesh of elements with a~maximal diameter $h$
and let $V_h$ be a~such enriched space that $u_s$ can be approximated exactly on the enriched domain $Z_R$, i.e.
\[
   \inf_{v\in V_h} \norm{u_s - v}_V = \inf_{v\in V^P_h} \norm{u_s|_{Z'_R} - v}_V, \quad Z'_R = \Omega\setminus Z_R.
\]
Using standard error estimate for elliptic PDE (e.g. \cite[Theorem 13.1]{ciarlet_basic_1991}), we get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:std_err_estimate}
    \norm{u - u_h}_{V} \le c_a \inf_{v \in V_h} \norm{u - v}_{V} 
    \le c_a \big(\inf_{v \in V^P_h} \norm{u_r - v}_{V} + \inf_{v \in V_h} \norm{u_s - v}_{V} \big).   
\end{equation}
where $c_a=1+\norm{a}/\gamma$.
In the following, we consider $V=H^1(\Omega)$, square grid and $V^P_h$ formed by bilinear finite elements. 
Then \eqref{eq:std_err_estimate} can be further estimated using approximation property of $V^P_h$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:particular_estimate}
    \norm{u - u_h}_{H^1(\Omega)} \le c_a \big(c h \abs{u_r}_{H^2(\Omega)} + \norm{u_s - \Pi u_s}_{H^1(Z'_R)} \big)   
\end{equation}
where $\Pi u_s$ denotes interpolation of $u_s$ in $V^P_h$. Our next aim is to find tight estimate for the second term.
To this end, we calculate $H^1$ error on a~single square element $S_{h,r}$ with side $h$ and distance $r$ from origin.
Using parametrization $0<s,t<1$,  we get

\begin{align*}
 (u_s - \Pi u_s)(s,t)&=\log\sqrt{(r+hs)^2+(ht)^2} -\Big[(1-s)(1-t)\log r\\
 &\quad+ (1-s)t\log\sqrt{r^2+h^2} + s(1-t) \log(r+h) \\
 &\quad+ st\log\sqrt{(r+h)^2+h^2} \Big]\\
 &=\frac12 \frac{h^2}{r^2}\big(t^2-t - s^2 +s\big) + O(\frac{h^3}{r^3})
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{equation}
 \nabla(u_s - \Pi u_s)(s,t) = \frac{h}{r^2} \Big( \frac12-s, t-\frac12 \Big) + O(\frac{h^2}{r^2}).
\end{equation}
Assuming $h<r$, we can neglect higher order terms. Then, we obtain by direct integration
\begin{align*}
 \norm{u_s - \Pi u_s}^2_{L^2(S_{h,r})} \approx \frac14 \frac{h^6}{r^4}\int_0^1\int_0^1 (t^2-t-s^2+s)^2\,\dd s\, \dd t = \frac{1}{360}\frac{h^6}{r^4} 
\end{align*}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:grad_estimate_on_square}
    \norm{\nabla(u_s - \Pi u_s)}^2_{L^2(S_{h,r})} \approx \frac{2h^4}{r^4} \int_0^1 \Big(t-\frac12\Big)^2 \dd t = \frac{1}{6}\frac{h^4}{r^4}.
\end{equation}
Thus for the density of squared error we have
\[
    \frac{1}{\abs{S_{h,r}}} \norm{u_s - \Pi u_s}^2_{H^1(S_{h,r})} \approx \frac{h^2}{6r^4}
\]
which after integration over the unenriched domain gives final estimate:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:singular_approx_error}
    \norm{u_s - \Pi u_s}_{H^1(Z'_R)} \le \left[\int_0^{2\pi} \int_R^\infty \frac{h^2} {6r^4} r \,\dd r\, \dd \phi\right]^{1/2} = \sqrt\frac{\pi}{6}\frac{h}{R}. 
\end{equation}

Recalling the estimate \eqref{eq:std_err_estimate}, we can conclude that optimal choice of the enrichment radius is $h/R\approx \norm{u_r-\Pi u_r}_{H^1(\Omega)}$, 
which balance error in the regular and the singular part. In combination with an a~posteriori error analysis, this could give a~rule for an automatic
determination of the enrichment radius.



\subsection{Numerical results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsubsection{Test problems} \label{sec:test_cases}
In this section, we define problems that we solve in our numerical experiments. We restrict ourselves to 
single aquifer problems for the purpose of this article but our implementation enables multi-aquifer systems 
as well. In order to measure convergence, it is desirable to have an analytic solution which will be also derived. 

Consider the following problem:
\begin{thmproblem} \label{thm:problem} Aquifer-well model with a~source term.
\begin{eqnarray}
-T \Lapl h &=& f \qquad \textrm{ in } \Omega \label{eqn:poisson}\\
h &=& h_D \qquad \textrm{ on } \Gamma_D, \label{eqn:dirichlet} \\
-T\grad h \cdot \vc{n}&=& \sigma_w\left( \langle h \rangle - H_w \right) 
          \qquad \textrm{ on } \partial B_w, \label{eqn:well_edge_bc} \\
-\int \limits_{\partial B_w} \sigma_w\left(\langle h\rangle - H_w\right) &=& c_w(H^1_w - H_w) \label{eqn:well_flow}\\
H^1_w &=& const. \label{eqn:well_top_bc}    
\end{eqnarray}
Domain $\Omega$ is a~square with a~diagonal of length $2D$ an exterior boundary $\Gamma_D$. 
The square is cut by a~well of radius $\rho_w$ which is placed at $\vc{x}_w$ and makes the interior boundary $\partial B_w$.

The Poisson equation \eqref{eqn:poisson} and the boundary conditions \eqref{eqn:dirichlet}-\eqref{eqn:well_edge_bc}
govern the pressure inside the aquifer. The flow balance equation \eqref{eqn:well_flow} and the boundary condition
\eqref{eqn:well_top_bc} govern the pressure inside the well ($H^1_w$ is the given pressure at the top of the aquifer).
We further set $T=1.0$ for simplicity and consider permeability $c_w$ of the well between the top and the aquifer.
\end{thmproblem}

We will now look for the analytic solution $[h, H_w]$.
Since we introduced the boundary condition \eqref{eqn:well_edge_bc} on the well boundary,
we require the solution gradient to be a~constant given by the difference of the average pressure along the well boundary 
and the pressure inside the well.

Now let us want the function
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:poisson_solution_aux}
  h(\vc{x}) = a\log(r) + b + U(r-\rho_w)^2 \sin(\omega x),
\end{equation}
to be the solution of \eqref{eqn:poisson} and find the corresponding source term $f$. Constant $U$ plays a~role
of a~scaling parameter for the amplitude of the $\sin$ part.
Applying Laplace operator to \eqref{eqn:poisson_solution_aux}, we obtain zero for the first logarithmic part and then
transforming the second part we get
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:source_term}
  f = -U\left[\left(4 - 2 \frac{\rho_w}{r} \right) \sin(\omega x)      
                    + 4(r-\rho_w)\frac{\vc{r}\cdot\vc{e}_1}{r} \omega\cos(\omega x)
                    - (r-\rho_w)^2\omega^2\sin(\omega x) \right]
\end{equation}

%TODO: describe the transform from a~ring solution to the square...
Next we find constants $a$, $b$ and $H_w$, by letting \eqref{eqn:poisson_solution_aux} satisfy \eqref{eqn:dirichlet}-\eqref{eqn:well_flow}.
We conclude the results in the following definition of the complete solution.
\begin{definition} \label{def:solution}
The solution $[h,H_w]$ of the problem \ref{thm:problem}
with the source term $f$~equal \eqref{eqn:source_term},
satisfying equations \eqref{eqn:poisson}-\eqref{eqn:well_top_bc}, is
\begin{eqnarray}
  h(\vc{x}) &=& a\log(r) + b + U(r-\rho_w)^2 \sin(\omega x), \label{eqn:poisson_solution}\\
  H_w &=& \frac{c_w(1-t) H^1_w + \bar{\sigma}_w h_D}{c_w(1-t) + \bar{\sigma}_w}, \label{eqn:well_solution}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
  a &=& \frac{\rho_w\sigma_w c_w (h_D-H^1_w)}{c_w(1-t) + |\partial B_w|\sigma_w}, \nonumber \\
  b &=& h_D - a\log D, \nonumber \\
  t &=& \rho_w\sigma_w\log\left(\frac{\rho_w}{D}\right). \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\end{definition}

The solution \eqref{eqn:poisson_solution} is then used to define the boundary function $h_D = h|_{\Gamma_D}$.

\end{figure}

Let us now define the input data. The domain $\Omega$ is a~square $(-2,2)\times(-2,2)$ and the well is characterized by 
$\bx_w=[0.004,0.004]$,  $\rho_w=0.0.003$, $H_w=9$, $\sigma_w=10^5$ and $c_w=10^{10}$, see geometry in \fig{fig:geometry}. 
The enrichment radius is set $R=0.3$.
The source term is set with parameters $U=0.02$ and $\omega=6$, see \fig{fig:solution}.

\subsubsection{Comparison of PU methods} \label{sec:res_comparison}

In the article \cite{exner_2016}, results with the zero source term ($U=0.0$) are presented at first. We only
remind the behaviour of FEM solution using adaptive mesh refinement.
We saw there in Figure 4, that the convergence in $L^2$ norm is very poor (order 0.56) until the size of elements 
reaches the scale of the well, then it increases to order 1.27. A very fine mesh is needed with FEM to capture 
the singularity but the error is still high.

Since we solved the convergence problems with non-zero source term, we shall present these results straight away.
We solve the Problem 1 with data given above with the methods described in \ref{sec:pum_methods} and compare them.
The linear algebraic system is always solved by conjugate gradients method (CG) with Jacobi preconditioning 
and tolerance $10^{-9}$. The error of the approximation is computed in $L^2$ norm and so the convergence is
considered in this norm.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
%   \vspace{0pt}
  \centering    
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\results convergence_sin.pdf}
  \caption[Convergence graph]{Convergence graph of different methods on in $L^2$ norm. The 'FEM (ur)'
  data comes from the problem without the well solved by standard FEM and with optimal convergence order 2.0.}
  \label{fig:convergence_sin}
\end{figure}

The results of the convergence test are presented in \fig{fig:convergence_sin}.
For the comparison, we also plot the error of the standard FEM approximation of the problem with the well omitted, 
It is labelled 'FEM (ur)' since the solution corresponds to the regular part $u_r$ of the solution \eqref{eqn:poisson_solution}  
and displays the optimal convergence order 2.0.

In the case of the standard FEM approximation, the convergence order is low 0.5, since it cannot capture the 
singularity at all.

The standard XFEM pushes the error down by three orders of magnitude. It has the optimal convergence rate with order 2.0 but the system
matrix condition number grows rapidly and for $h<0.02$ the CG solver does not converge even in 10000 iterations. The same
problem rises up using the ramp function XFEM. It deals better with the error on blending elements but the
ill-conditioning of the system matrix still corrupts the computation. We discuss the conditioning of the system 
a little bit more in the next subsection \ref{sec:res_conditioning}.

The shifted XFEM and the SGFEM behave nearly the same way and give the best results. We only mention that the SGFEM saves 
small amount of degrees of freedom on blending elements in comparison with the shifted and the ramp function XFEM.
The order of convergence in $L^2$ norm closing to 2.0 is optimal.

Regarding the order convergence 1.8 presented by Gracie and Craig \cite{gracie_modelling_2010}, we obtained similar convergence order 
around 1.7-1.8 in our experiments using the original adaptive quadrature. Although, the order could be lower 
depending on the position of the well to the nodes of the mesh. We do not experience this behaviour with our adaptive
quadrature and the convergence order is always close to the optimum of 2.0.

The error of the shifted XFEM and the SGFEM addressed in \cite{exner_2016} is suppressed due to two improvements. 
Firstly the averaged form of the interior boundary condition enforces the constant flow along the well edge
which agrees better with the solution.
Secondly the analytic solution has been derived precisely, including the effect of the well permeability $c_w$.



\subsubsection{Conditioning of the system matrix} \label{sec:res_conditioning}
We shall write here a~brief note about the conditioning of the system.
Condition number for matrices resulting from a~conforming FEM applied to Laplace equation is $O(h^{-2})$, so the iteration count 
for CG without preconditioning is $O(h^{-1})=O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n=1/h^2$ is number of degrees of freedom in case of linear finite elements. 
With local preconditioning (Jacobi, 
SOR, ILU) one can usually achieve the number of iterations $O(h^{-0.5})$, c.f. \cite{ern_evaluation_2006}.

Let us use the data from the numerical tests above in \ref{sec:res_comparison}.
We observe the iteration count needed by CG solver in \fig{fig:iterations}.
The number of iterations of the standard FEM is corresponding to the classic results as mentioned in the paragraph above. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
%   \vspace{0pt}
  \centering    
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\results iterations.pdf}
  \caption[Iterations graph]{Graph of dependence of the CG iteration count on the 
  number of degrees of freedom. Measured on both problems with no serious distinction observed.}
  \label{fig:iterations}
\end{figure}
%
We can see clearly the enormous growth of the number of iterations in case of the standard XFEM and the ramp 
function XFEM. These problems are generally known and are described for example in the overview of the XFEM in
\cite{fries_xfem_overview_2010}. The usage of enrichment functions can make the approximation space almost linearly 
dependent from which the ill-conditioning of the system arises. That is exactly what the SGFEM was developed to deal with.

Summarizing the theory in \cite{babuska_stable_2012}, we can say that the conditioning of the SGFEM system is not worse than that of the 
standard FEM system. We have only the number of iterations on the standard FEM system for comparison, 
but we see from the graph in \fig{fig:iterations} that the results in case of the SGFEM are satisfying.
Number of iterations needed by the shifted XFEM is similarly good. This area of the problem would need deeper 
investigation.

\subsubsection{Dependence on the enrichment radius}
The aim of this section is twofold: we first validate the estimate \eqref{eq:grad_estimate_on_square}, secondly we study 
the dependence of the error in $L^2$ norm on the enrichment radius numerically and compare it with \eqref{eq:singular_approx_error}.

\end{figure}
%
Validity of the estimate \eqref{eq:grad_estimate_on_square} is verified by a~calculation of the ratio
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:log_h1_estimate_ratio}
\frac{h^{3/2} r^{-2} 12^{-1/2}}{\|u_s - \Pi u_s\|^2_{H^1(T)}},\quad u_s(\vc x) = \log \abs{\vc x}
\end{equation}
on every element $T$ of the sequence of refined meshes using a~$5\times5$ Gaussian quadrature for the estimation of the $H^1$ norm. Table 
\ref{tab:log_h1_estimate} reports the minimum and the maximum values of the ratio over all elements of every mesh.
The minimum values are close to 1 independently of $h$ which is in perfect agreement with \eqref{eq:grad_estimate_on_square}.
Moreover, the minimum value is attained on the majority of
elements, see \fig{fig:log_estimate_b}. Both parts of \fig{fig:log_estimate} demonstrate also higher convergence rate on diagonal elements
where the nonlinear term of the bilinear finite elements allows better approximation of the saddle shaped logarithmic surface.

Next, we study the influence of the enrichment radius $R$ on the global $L^2$ error. To this end, we solve Problem 2 with parameter $U=3$
using the shifted XFEM for different mesh steps and different values of $R$.
Let us remind that $O(h^p)$ convergence of the solution in the $H^1$ norm translates to the $O(h^{p+1})$ convergence of the solution in the $L^2$ norm 
for the linear elliptic problems (c.f. \cite[Theorem 19.2]{ciarlet_basic_1991}). According to the estimates \eqref{eq:std_err_estimate}
and \eqref{eq:singular_approx_error}, we expect $O(h^2)$ convergence of $L^2$ norm independently of the enrichment radius. This is 
clearly demonstrated in \fig{fig:radius_conv_1}. For comparison, we plot also the error of the regular part of the solution
\[
  u_r(x,y) = U(r-\rho_w)^2 \sin(\omega x)
\]
solved by standard FEM showing the $O(h^2)$ convergence.
As predicted, the total error diminishes with $R$ but cannot 
drop under the error of $u_r$. We approximate $\norm{u_r - \Pi u_r}_{H^1(\Omega)}$
using a~fine mesh and then according to \eqref{eq:singular_approx_error},
we get the optimal value of the enrichment radius
\[
    R_o \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{6}} h/\norm{u_r - \Pi u_r}_{H^1(\Omega)} \sim 0.36
\]
This value roughly matches a~point in the plots of the error as a~function of $R$ in
\fig{fig:radius_conv_2}, from which the error is not decreasing any more.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The aim of this part was the investigation of the usage of four partition of unity methods -- the XFEM, its corrected version with the ramp 
function, the shifted XFEM, and the SGFEM. The problem setting was inspired by the work \cite{gracie_modelling_2010,craig_using_2011} 
of R.~Gracie and J.R.~Craig but our effort was aimed more in understanding details of the PU methods and their comparison
rather than in computation of complex problems. Resolving a~point singularity in a~2D domain was addressed.

The issue of a~sub-optimal convergence order reported in \cite{gracie_modelling_2010} was investigated. 
We revealed the problem and we suggested a~better strategy for the adaptive quadrature. 
The improvement was confirmed by the numerical tests in \ref{sec:res_comparison} where we obtained the optimal 
order of convergence in $L^2$ norm.

All the implemented methods were compared in \ref{sec:res_comparison}. Regarding the XFEM, we saw that at 
least the ramp function must be used in order to optimize the error on the blending elements. 
The shifted XFEM and the SGFEM converged optimally and did not show any difference in the solution precision.

The ill-conditioning of the system matrix was encountered when using the standard XFEM and the ramp function XFEM.
The iteration count of conjugate gradients method was measured.

Also the choice of the optimal enrichment radius was studied. The error estimate dependent on the enrichment
radius was derived and it was numerically validated. Furthermore, the optimal enrichment radius was predicted 
for the test problem and it corresponded with the computed data.

In addition to article \cite{exner_2016} the model formulation was tuned with the averaged term on the well
boundary. The precise analytic solution for a~well-aquifer model was also derived.

An alternative quadrature for integration of enriched functions in polar coordinates was suggested.
The quadrature was implemented but the numerical results were not satisfying. This would need a~deeper 
investigation on the parameters that are needed to be set and a~possible bug in a~code is not excluded.
